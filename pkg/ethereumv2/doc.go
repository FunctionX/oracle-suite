// Package ethereumv2 provides interfaces to interact with the Ethereum
// compatible blockchains. It is intended to replace the ethereum package.
// After the ethereum package is removed, this package will be renamed to
// ethereum.
//
// For now, there is only one implementation of the rpcclient, but in the
// future, there may be a need for specific implementations for different L2s.
// The same may be true for rpcsplitter.
